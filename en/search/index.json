[{"content":"This is a classic but difficult chessboard problem. Although it is the topic of NOIP in 2000, it is still quite difficult for first-time contacts as the final topic. This paper summarizes three different solutions: Dynamic Planning, DFS Memorization, and Minimum Cost Maximum Flow, which unfolds gradually from easy to difficult.\n题目背景与描述 NOIP 2000 improvement group T4\nQuestion description\nThere is a square diagram of N × N (N ≤ 9), some of which we fill in positive integers, while others put the number 0. Someone starts at point A (0, 0) in the top left corner of the diagram and can walk down or to the right until they reach point B (N, N) in the bottom right corner.On the way he walks, he can take the number in the square (which becomes the number 0). This person walked from point A to point B twice, trying to find 2 such paths, so that the sum of the obtained numbers is the maximum.\nDate input format\nThe first line of the input is an integer N (representing the grid diagram of N × N), the next line has three integers, the first two represent the position, and the third number is the number put on the position. A separate line of 0 indicates the end of the input.\nOutput format\nJust output an integer representing the maximum sum obtained on the 2 paths.\nSample input/output\nMasukkan\n9\n2 3 13\n2 6 6\n3 5 7\n4 4 14\n5 2 21\n5 6 4\n6 3 15\n= 7×2 = 14)\n0 0 0\nOutput 67\nInstructions/Tips\nData range: 1 ≤ N ≤ 9.\nI initially tried to enumerate the matrix that had been changed (that is, simulated) again after a round of enumeration, but found that the difficulty was a little too great. Finally, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of a solution, so I found Claude. The solution it gave was to use the dp algorithm (see method 1 for details). I also thought of the algorithm of DFS combined with pruning (thank you for the maze problem I did before, it is an algorithm problem related to the minimum number of steps, which is just suitable for DFS combined with pruning) (see method 2 for details). Later, Claude also gave an algorithm that is suitable for general solutions - the cost flow solution method (too difficult, belonging to the hyper-schema solution method, sketching one or two, see method 3 for details).\nps. Explain why two enums cannot be taken. One path changes the map, affecting the second, so the two paths must be considered in conjunction.\n解法一（dp 动态规划）： Core idea: Advance both paths simultaneously and simulate two people walking at the same time with one DP.\nState design: set dp [k] [x1] [x2], where:\nk is the number of steps currently taken (i.e. the value of x + y, from 2 to 2N)\nx1 and x2 are the line numbers where the two people are currently located.\nBy k and x can be derived y = k - x (key, this step reduces the dimension), so the column number does not need to be stored separately\nDeduplication: When two people are in the same cell (x1 = = x2, then y1 = = y2), the cell is taken only once.\nTransfer: Two people each can choose to move to the right or down for a total of 4 combinations.\nFull Code __ code_block_0 __\nTime complexity: O (N ³)\n# # Solution 2 (DFS + pruning): Core idea: Similar to the dp algorithm (after all, deep search and dp are essentially one thing), but adds the step of memorized search, avoiding repetitive searches. (If there is no memory search, the amount of calculation will be an exponential explosion, about 4 ^ 16 times at N = 9)\nFull Code __ code_block_1 __\nTime complexity: O (N ³)\n# # Solution 3 (Cost Flow Solution): Core idea: Convert \u0026ldquo;maximizing the two paths\u0026rdquo; into a network flow problem.\nModeling Ideas Key Observations: Two paths from A to B = 2 flows from source to sink Fetch at most once per cell = 1 capacity per node Get number max = cost max (min to min)\nSplit point: Each grid (i, j) is split into two nodes in and out: in → out: Capacity 1, Cost -map [i] [j] (minimize costs by minimizing costs) in → out: add one more capacity 1, cost 0 (allow the second path to go through but do not take repeated values) Namely: Consolidated to Capacity 2, but only the first unit stream has revenue\nConnected edges: (i, j) out connects (i +1, j) in and (i, j +1) in, capacity 2, cost 0.\nSource sink: The source point S is connected to (1,1) .in, (N, N) .out is connected to the sink point T, and the traffic is 2.\nAfter splitting each grid (i, j):\n__ code_block_2 __\nFull code (MCMF, SPFA implementation) __ code_block_3 __\nAdvantage: Easily scales to K paths.\n","date":"2026-02-28T11:31:00+08:00","permalink":"https://w2343419-del.github.io/WangScape/en/p/p1004-noip-2000-improvement-group-grid-score-analysis-and-summary/","title":"P1004 [NOIP 2000 improvement group] grid score analysis and summary"},{"content":"After nearly a day of half-day self-doubt, half-day struggle with AI (doge) and all-day hardness ratio with head and table\u0026hellip;\nJanuary 21, 2026 finally became an extraordinary day for me.\nMy personal blog is finally live!!!\n博客的目标 I will record here:\nSummary of difficulties, gains and knowledge points encountered in programming -Learning experience and algorithmic analysis Occasional complaints and book reviews Favorite poems and other cultural content Maybe this blog will be my all-disciplinary notebook?
