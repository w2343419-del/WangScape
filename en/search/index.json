[{"content":"This is a classic but difficult chessboard model problem. Although it is a NOIP problem in 2000, it is still quite difficult for first-time contacts like me as the finale.\nLook at the background of the question first\nNOIP 2000 improvement group T4\nQuestion description\nThere is a square diagram of N × N (N ≤ 9), some of which we fill in positive integers, while others put the number 0. Someone starts at point A (0, 0) in the top left corner of the diagram and can walk down or to the right until they reach point B (N, N) in the bottom right corner.On the way he walks, he can take the number in the square (which becomes the number 0). This person walked from point A to point B twice, trying to find 2 such paths, so that the sum of the obtained numbers is the maximum.\nDate input format\nThe first line of the input is an integer N (representing the grid diagram of N × N), the next line has three integers, the first two represent the position, and the third number is the number put on the position. A separate line of 0 indicates the end of the input.\nOutput format\nJust output an integer representing the maximum sum obtained on the 2 paths.\nSample input/output\nMasukkan\n9\n2 3 13\n2 6 6\n3 5 7\n4 4 14\n5 2 21\n5 6 4\n6 3 15\n= 7×2 = 14)\n0 0 0\nOutput 67\nInstructions/Tips\nData range: 1 ≤ N ≤ 9.\nI initially tried to enumerate the matrix that had been changed (that is, simulated) again after a round of enumeration, but found that the difficulty was a little too great. Finally, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of a solution, so I found Claude. The solution it gave was to use the dp algorithm (see method 1 for details). I also thought of the algorithm of DFS combined with pruning (thank you for the maze problem I did before, it is an algorithm problem related to the minimum number of steps, which is just suitable for DFS combined with pruning) (see method 2 for details). Later, Claude also gave an algorithm that is suitable for general solutions - the cost flow solution method (too difficult, belonging to the hyper-schema solution method, sketching one or two, see method 3 for details).\nps. Explain why two enums cannot be taken. One path changes the map, affecting the second, so the two paths must be considered in conjunction.\nSolution 1 (dp dynamic programming):\nCore idea: Advance both paths simultaneously and simulate two people walking at the same time with one DP.\nState design: set dp [k] [x1] [x2], where:\nk is the number of steps currently taken (i.e. the value of x + y, from 2 to 2N)\nx1 and x2 are the line numbers where the two people are currently located.\nBy k and x can be derived y = k - x (key, this step reduces the dimension), so the column number does not need to be stored separately\nDeduplication: When two people are in the same cell (x1 = = x2, then y1 = = y2), the cell is taken only once.\nTransfer: Two people each can choose to move to the right or down for a total of 4 combinations.\nFull Code __ code_block_0 __\\ n\\ n\nTime complexity: O (N ³)\nSolution 2 (DFS + pruning):\nCore idea: Similar to the dp algorithm (after all, deep search and dp are essentially one thing), but adds the step of memorized search, avoiding repetitive searches. (If there is no memory search, the amount of calculation will be an exponential explosion, about 4 ^ 16 times at N = 9)\nFull code __ code_block_1 __\\ n\\ n\nTime complexity: O (N ³)\nSolution 3 (Cost Flow Solution):\nCore idea: Convert \u0026ldquo;maximizing the two paths\u0026rdquo; into a network flow problem.\nModeling Ideas Key Observations: Two paths from A to B = 2 flows from source to sink Fetch at most once per cell = 1 capacity per node Get number max = cost max (min to min)\nSplit point: Each grid (i, j) is split into two nodes in and out: in → out: Capacity 1, Cost -map [i] [j] (minimize costs by minimizing costs) in → out: add one more capacity 1, cost 0 (allow the second path to go through but do not take repeated values) Namely: Consolidated to Capacity 2, but only the first unit stream has revenue\nConnected edges: (i, j) out connects (i +1, j) in and (i, j +1) in, capacity 2, cost 0.\nSource sink: The source point S is connected to (1,1) .in, (N, N) .out is connected to the sink point T, and the traffic is 2.\nAfter splitting each grid (i, j):\nCapacity 1, cost-val (first way through, take the number) in (i, j) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \u0026gt; out (i, j) Capacity 1, cost 0 (second way through, number taken)\nFull code (MCMF, SPFA implementation) __ code_block_2 __\\ n\\ n\nTime complexity: O (E · SPFA)\nAdvantage: Easily scales to K paths.\n","date":"2026-02-28T11:31:00+08:00","permalink":"https://w2343419-del.github.io/WangScape/en/p/p1004-noip-2000-improvement-group-grid-score-analysis-and-summary/","title":"P1004 [NOIP 2000 improvement group] grid score analysis and summary"},{"content":"After nearly a day of half a day of self-doubt, half a day of fighting with AI (doge), and a whole day of using your head and table harder than anyone else\u0026hellip;\nJanuary 21, 2026 finally became an extraordinary day for me.\nMy personal blog is finally live!!!\nI will record my learning experience on my blog, occasionally complain, and even occasionally write a book review (and even record some of my favorite poems)\nI will record the difficulties I have encountered in programming, the harvest, and a summary of some knowledge points.\nThis blog might also be my all-disciplinary notebook?
