After a full day of self-doubt, debugging, and wrestling with tools, this blog finally went online.

January 21, 2026 became a special day for me.

## What I plan to write

I will mainly use this space to record:

- Programming problems I run into and how I solve them
- Algorithm notes and learning summaries
- Occasional reflections, book notes, and favorite poems
- Broader interests such as AI, games, music, and films

This blog may also become my cross-discipline notebook during university.

## Final note

I cannot promise perfect consistency, but I will do my best to keep updating.

The site is still rough around the edges for now, and I will keep improving it over time.
