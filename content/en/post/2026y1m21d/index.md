After nearly a day of half a day of self-doubt, half a day of fighting with AI (doge), and a whole day of using your head and table harder than anyone else...

January 21, 2026 finally became an extraordinary day for me.

My personal blog is finally live!!!

I will record my learning experience on my blog, occasionally complain, and even occasionally write a book review (and even record some of my favorite poems)

I will record the difficulties I have encountered in programming, the harvest, and a summary of some knowledge points.

This blog might also be my all-disciplinary notebook?(University Only)

(Although I don't know if I can maintain my blog all the time, after all, it's lazy, do your best)

Of course, I will also record some other things, not only in terms of code, but also in terms of artificial intelligence?Algorithmic?Or, in terms of gaming?

Or, music? Movies?

I will do my best to make blogging learning-oriented, hopefully.

I hope my update frequency is not too low...

That's it, it's time to continue fixing the bug...



(ps. Now the blog is still rough, it will be better in the future!)
