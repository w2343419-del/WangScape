After nearly a day of half-day self-doubt, half-day struggle with AI (doge) and all-day hardness ratio with head and table...

January 21, 2026 finally became an extraordinary day for me.

My personal blog is finally live!!!

## 博客的目标

I will record here:

- Summary of difficulties, gains and knowledge points encountered in programming
-Learning experience and algorithmic analysis
- Occasional complaints and book reviews
- Favorite poems and other cultural content

Maybe this blog will be my all-disciplinary notebook? (at least during university)

In addition to code, it may also involve artificial intelligence, games, music, movies and other fields. I do my best to keep my blog focused on learning.

## 写在末尾

Although I don't know if I can always maintain this blog (a bit lazy after all), I will do my best.

I hope my update frequency is not too low...

(ps. Blogs are rough now, but better later!)
