After spending half a day in self-doubt, another half-day wrestling with AI, and a full day testing whether my head or my desk is harder...

January 21st, 2026, has finally become a day to remember.

My personal blog is officially live!

I plan to use this space to document my learning journey, vent a little when things get tough, and occasionally share book reviews or even some of my favorite poetry when inspiration strikes.

Specifically, you’ll find:

Study Notes: Summaries of key concepts and breakthroughs in my coding journey.

Academic Archive: This might even evolve into a comprehensive notebook for all my university subjects.

Life & Hobbies: Beyond the technical stuff, I might dive into Artificial Intelligence, algorithms, or even my interests in gaming, music, and movies.

I’ll do my best to keep this blog focused on learning—at least, that’s the plan! Though I’ll admit I can be a bit lazy sometimes, I’m committed to maintaining this space as much as I can. I just hope my update frequency doesn't drop too low...

That’s all for now. It’s time to go back and squash the remaining bugs!

(P.S. The site is still a bit rough around the edges, but I promise it’ll get better over time!)
